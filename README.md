See file originalREADME.md for initial instructions.

Completed user stories for the "Airport Challenge". Created classes for Airport, Plane and Weather and wrote code that allows a plane to take off and land from a given airport, unless the weather is "raining". Tests added to ensure working functionality and projected completed via the TDD methodology. Rspecs all pass and there are no improvements listed via the rubocod command. 

Although not a user story, instructions mention a randomisation of the weather and I need to complete, along with test (with stubs) for this.
